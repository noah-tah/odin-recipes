            <ol>
                <li class="instruction">First get some sort of deep casserole type dish and lightly grease the bottom and sides with a tablespoon or so of the oil and begin heating your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. </li>
                <li class="instruction">Then begin heating a the rest of the oil in the skillet over medium heat.

                <li class="instruction">In another skillet in between toritllas, begin browning your pound of ground beef in another skillet. Once the beef is browned, strain out the fat, then return to the frying pan.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Add a package of Taco Seasoning to the beef and a cup of water, then bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn heat to low and simmer for 5-15 minutes depending on the amount of time you have.</li>
                <li class="instruction">By now, you should have all your toritllas lightly fried, and beef browned and seasoned.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Now open your can of enchilada sauce, and line the bottom and sides of the pan with a bit of the enchilada sauce, then prepare your working station where you will be rolling the enchiladas, prepare for a mess.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Begin by taking a fried tortilla, adding a scoop of beef, then rolling it tight, and placing it seam side down onto the enchilada sauce lined casserole dish. Repeat until casserole dish is full.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Put any remaining beef on top of the rolled enchiladas to use the rest of it for a meat sauce in the end.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Spoon over the Enchilada Sauce evenly across all the rolled enchiladas until no sauce remains, and no enchilada remains dry.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Finally, put entire bag of shredded cheese on top of the enchilada casserole you have created, distributed evenly.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Place into 400 degree fahrenheit oven for 20-25 minutes, but keep an eye on it because different casserole dishes and oven combinations cook at different rates of speed. My best advice is to just keep an eyes on it.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Let cool for 5-10 minutes! The more patient you are, the easier it will be to elegantly serve them, but I typicallly devour these immediately myself.</li>
