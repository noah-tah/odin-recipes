            <ol>
                <li class="instruction">Heat a cast iron pan ripping hot, and allow to preheat for a few minutes.</li>
                <li class="instruction">While heating pan, salt steak liberally all over. Save the pepper for the end.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Once pan is hot to the touch on the handle, you know the pan is ready</li>
                <li class="instruction">Put high heat oil into the pan, then place steak slowly and lay the steak away from you to avoid getting burned.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Don't touch the steak! Let is sear for at least a few minutes, and the steak lifts easily from the pan.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Once you get a good sear on both sides, make sure to render any fat you see on the sides of your steak, depending on the cut your cooking.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Once you're about happy with the browning place the butter in garlic in the pan, and then place the rosemary on top of the steak, place the steak to the top of the pan, then tilt the pan backwards using a heat safe glove.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Begin spooning the hot garlic butter over the steak, basting it constantly and quickly. Continue until you reach your desired doneness.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing! This will allow for the carry over cooking to finish, and for the steak to maintain all of the juices contained when we cut it!</li>
